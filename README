NAME
    Linux::net::dev - Perl extension for parsing /proc/net/dev

SYNOPSIS
      use Linux::net::dev;
      my $devs = Linux::net::dev::info();
      print "Devices (bytes read):\n";
      foreach (keys %$devs) {
        print "  $_ ($devs->{$_}->{rbytes})\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Linux::net::dev parses /proc/net/dev for network devices statistics. The
    package contains these functions:

    info
        This function returns hash reference. Keys are devices' ids and
        values are data hash references. Data hash has resource names for
        keys and their respective values as associated values.

    dev Takes device id as a single argument and returns that device's data.

    devs
        Takes list of device ids as arguments and returns array with those
        devices' data.

    Recognized resources (data hash keys): rbytes, rcompressed, rdrop,
    rerrs, rfifo, rframe, rmulticast, rpackets, tbytes, tcarrier, tcolls,
    tcompressed, tdrop, terrs, tfifo, tpackets,

    Resources begining with "r" are values for read data, and those begining
    with "t" are values for transmited data.

    Package was built and tested on RedHat 7.2, kernel 2.4.7-10 and might
    not work on some other versions. Please report bugs along with your
    kernel version (uname -r or uname -a).
